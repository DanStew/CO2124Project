# Submission : 

Submit a single zip file (username1_username2_username3) containing 3 files (part1.zip, part2.zip and a word doc)

# Part 1 - Rest API : 

## Task 1 - Design and Documentation [ 40 Marks ] : 

Swagger editor to design and document an API
Each endpoint must have two responses
Must be done using OpenAPI3
More info on the assignment

Must submit the file in YAML format, named part1.yaml. Placed in the resources folder

Info to help describe the content of each resource :  https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body

## Task 2 - Implementation [ 40 Marks ] : 

Implement the Rest API for Task 1, must implement code for all endpoints and all controllers, that have been requested

## Task 3 - Testing [ 20 Marks ] : 

Postman, to make two test requests for each endpoint (One successful, One error)

Create a Postman Collection and ensure that all tests run in sequence
More notes about this on the doc
Export as JSON and place in resources folder

## Marking Criteria : 

ALL required endpoints have been correctly documented in the spec
ALL required endpoints have been implemented and run as expected, matching perfectly the documentation
Postman Collection contains one successful and error test case for each endpoint, all tests execute correctly



# Part 2 - Android App : 

For this, you need to implement a List of Features, with each feature worth different marks.

In the submission, must clean project and export as a zip file (part2.zip)

## List of Features : 

List Courses (10)

Create Course (15)

View Course Details (10)

Delete Course (10)

Add Student to Course (15)

View Student Details (15)

Edit/ Update Student Record (15)

General Design and Layout Presentation (10)

More information about the specific implementation of each can be found on the doc

## Marking Criteria : 

ALL required features have been implemented correctly
Application is well designed, with clean and intuitive user interface
The code is efficient, well-structured and follows best practises
Well-organised code is very important (80%), inefficiency not so much (only needed for 100%)
